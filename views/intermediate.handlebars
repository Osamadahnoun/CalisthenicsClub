          <div>In order to do standard pushups correctly, place your hands at the level of your chest, keep your butt squeezed and your abs engaged, and only bend at the elbows. Your torso should never change its position throughout the movement. 
              Keep your scapula (aka shoulder blades) retracted at the bottom of the exercise.</div>
