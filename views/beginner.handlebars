          <div>
              Find a doorway or a wall that is only ~8 inches wide where you can easily grasp both sides of it. Make sure that you can grip it safely. Bring your feet as close to the wall as possible and let your arms fully extend which will shift your body weight backward.
              Pull yourself back towards the wall and pinch your scapula together at the top. Slowly return back to the start.
