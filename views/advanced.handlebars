          <div>The uneven push-up begins to train each arm individually. By placing one hand higher than the other, you isolate the bottom arm to do more work overall. Just make sure to train both sides evenly.

      <li class="list-group-item two h5 bg-primary text-white mb-0">
          <div>The one hand push-up is an exercise that demonstrates a good deal of strength. Only attempt it if you have developed a great foundation of strength in all of the other variations.
            Initially, you may only be able to do it with a wide foot stance and a slight bend in the upper body, but as you get stronger, you can bring your feet closer together.

          <div>This exercise requires a sturdy box or a chair. Simple stand ~6 inches in front of it and balance yourself on one leg. From here, begin squatting down in a smooth controlled motion while keeping your other leg straight out in front of you for balance.
            Slowly sit down on the box, pause for a 1 count and push back up with the working leg, while never letting your other leg touch the ground.
